Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) techniques are studied, including visual, laser, or other sensor-based SLAM methods. Develop algorithms and techniques that enable devices to build maps and Orient themselves in unknown environments.
Data Fusion: Explore how data from different sensors can be fused together for highly accurate navigation and map construction. This may include research on sensor calibration, coordinate conversion, and data synchronization.

Hardware Platform Development
------
Design and manufacture hardware platforms, including GNSS Receivers, Inertial Measurement Units, Sensors, Computing Units, to support data acquisition and processing.

Software Development And Algorithm Design
------
(1) GNSS/INS fusion algorithm: Develop filtering algorithm to effectively integrate GNSS and INS data to provide high-precision position and attitude information.
(2) SLAM algorithm: Select the SLAM algorithm suitable for the needs of the project, including SLAM based on vision, laser or depth sensor, to achieve map construction and real-time positioning.
(3) Data fusion: Design data fusion algorithms to fuse different sensor data together to optimize navigation and map construction.

Field Testing And Validation
------
Select a variety of test scenarios, including indoor, urban canyons, signal outage areas, and more, to verify system performance and robustness.Rigorous testing of hardware and software, including performance testing, environmental testing and data conformance verification.

Application Development
------
Develop relevant applications and interfaces for different application areas (such as autonomous driving, indoor navigation, military, logistics, etc.) to fully realize the potential of the combined receiver. Work with industry partners to apply the technology to real-world scenarios, get feedback and continuously improve the system.

Commercialization And Promotion
------
Promote the application of the developed technology in the commercial market and actively seek potential customers and partners to promote the project results. Training and support are provided to ensure that users are able to use combination receivers and related applications effectively.
The technical solution of the project implementation needs to span hardware, software, algorithms and field validation to ensure that the GNSS/INS, SLAM/INS/GNSS combined receiver has high performance and practicality in multiple application fields.
